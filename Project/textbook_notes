Pure ALOHA
1. Users transmit frames whenever they have.
2. Colliding frames will be damaged.
3. A sender can find out whether its transmission succeed by
	1). listening to the channel.
	2). acknowledgement.
4. If the frame was damaged, wait a random time + send again.
5. Frame size is uniform.

	X: frame transmission time.(frame length/bit rate)
	N: average # of frames generated per frame time(X).(0 < N < 1)
	G: load, average # of transmission attempts per frame time(X).(includes both the old and new frames)
	P: probability of a successful frame transmission.
	S: throughout, average # of successful frame transmission per frame time(X).

	S = GP
