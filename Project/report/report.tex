\section*{Introduction}

What is MAC protocol?\\
In this project, we will simulate four MAC protocals including ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA, CSMA and CSMA/CD. For each protocal, the basic thoeries will be introduced first, then several assumptions that clarify ...

\section*{Pure ALOHA}

\subsection*{Theories}

ALOHA was devised by Norman Abramson in the 1970s to solve the channel allocation problem. The basic idea of pure ALOHA is that users(or stations) can transimit frames whenever they have, which is totally random. Of course, when different users are transmiting their frames at the same time, those frames will collide and all of them will be damaged. A sender can find out whether its transmission succeed by checking the acknowledgements from the receiver. If the frame was damadged, it waits for a random time and send again. \\

Given the following parameters: \\

\qquad	\(X\): frame transmission time \\

\qquad	\(N\): average \# of frames genereted per frame time \\

\qquad	\(G\): load, average \# of transmission attempts per frame time \\

\qquad	\(k\): \# of transmissions attempts per frame time \\

\qquad	\(P\): probablity of a successful frame transmission \\

\qquad	\(S\): throughput, average \# of successful frames per frame time \\

We can derive that the probability that \(k\) frames are generated during a frame time \(X\) is given by the Poisson distribution \\

\qquad	\(P(k) = \frac{G^ke^{-G}}{k!}\) \\

So the probability of zero frames during the \(2G\) vulnerable time is \\

\qquad \(P(0)|_{G=2G} = e^{-2G}\) \\

Then the throughput is given by \\

\qquad \(S = Ge^{-2G}\) \\

for which the maximum occurs at \(G = 0.5\) with \(S = 1/2e \approx 0.184\) and the \(S - G\) graph is shown on Figure 1.

\subsection*{Assumptions}

1. The length of each frame remains the same. \\
2. There is no propagation delay which means that one user can know whether its frames transmission succeed as soon as it finished its transimission. \\
3. The probability of an arrival during a short time interval \(\Delta t\) is propotional to the length of interval, and does not depend on the origin of the interval. \\
4. The probability of having multiple(\(>\) 1) arrivals during a short time interval \(\Delta t\) approaches 0;

\subsection*{Simulation}

In the simulation program, an two-dimensional array containing 0s and 1s is used to represent states of different users at each short time interval \(\Delta t\). For example, statest[\emph{userNum}][\emph{slotNum}] is an \emph{userNum}\(\times\)\emph{slotNum} array, its Nth(0 \(<\) N \(<\) \emph{userNum}) row represents that the Nth user's states from 0th to (\emph{slotNum}-1)th short time interval. "0" is used when the user is not transmitting data at a certain short time interval and "1" is used otherwise. \\

The array can be expressed graphically like this: \\

states[\emph{N}][\emph{M}]: \\

\qquad user1: 111111000111111\(\cdots\)0000000001111110000000 \\

\qquad user2: 001111110000000\(\cdots\)0001111110000000000111 \\

\qquad\quad \(\vdots\) \hspace{35mm} \(\vdots\) \\

\qquad userN: \hspace{-0.5mm}\(\underbrace{000000011111100\cdots1111110000001111110000}_\text{M short time intervals}\) \\

Since the frame length(frameLen) is assumed to be constant, the number of consetutive 1s remains the same(except the frames at the end of each row). The above example always has 6 consetutive 1s which represents a 6-slot length frame. \\

At the beginnig of each simulation, the array need to be initialized based on a given probability \(p\) which is the probability that a user generates a frame during a certain short time interval \(\Delta t\). Once the first state is initialized to be 1, its consetutive (frameLen - 1) states should all be set to 1.

\section*{Slotted ALOHA}


\subsection*{Theories}

Slotted ALOHA is an advanced version of pure ALOHA. It divides time into descrete slots that each frame can only be sent at the beginning of each time slot. Moreover, slotted ALOHA requires global time synchronization so that the same slot boundaries can be agreed by all the users.

The vulnerable time for slotted ALOHA is half of the one for pure ALOHA. So the probability of zero frames during the G vulnerable time is \\

\qquad \(P(0)|_{G=G} = e^{-G}\) \\

Then the throughput is given by \\

\qquad \(S = Ge^{-G}\) \\

for which the maximum occurs at \(G = 1\) with \(S = 1/e \approx 0.368\) and the \(S - G\) graph is shown on Figure 1.

\section*{CSMA}


\section*{CSMA/CD}

\subsection*{Theories}

At a given moment, user A has a packet to send. Before starting transmission, it checks whether the medium is idle or not. If the medium is busy, the user waits a random time and then tries again. If the medium is idle, the user starts to transmit, and keeps sensing the medium. Once a collision signal is detected, rather than finishing sending the packet, the station stops sending immediately and waits for the next attempt. \\

For choosing the random time, the protocol uses the Binary Exponential Backoff Algorithm. According to the algorithm, time is divided into discrete slots whose length is equal to the worst-case round-trip propagation time on the ether. After the first collision, the station waits either 0 or 1 slot time before another try. After the second collision, the station chooses either 0, 1, 2 or 3 slots randomly and waits that number of slot time. Thus, by the same rule, after kth collision, the number of time slots to wait is chosen randomly from the interval 0 to \(2^k-1\). \\

Theoretically, the maximum throughput is given by: \\

\qquad \(\rho_{max} = \frac{X}{X+t_{prop}+2et_{prop}} = \frac{1}{1+(2e+1)a}\) \\

where \(a = \frac{t_{prop}}{X} = \frac{Rd}{vL}\)(\(R\): transmission rate, \(L\): frame length, \(v\): light speed in medium, \(d\): diameter of system, \(X\): frame time). \\

\subsection*{Assumptions}

1. The propagation time is assumed to be the smallest time unit in the entire design and set to be 1 time slot. \\
2. The "medium" is set to be a station with 1 time slot delay to all other stations. \\
3. The duration of the simulation is in the unit of time slots. \\
4. The states of all users during the whole process are saved in a large array and the size of it is the number of users times the duration.

\subsection*{Simulation}

The Simplified Procedure of the Program:
1) The program user sets the number of stations, the probability of a station having a frame to send and the duration of the program. \\

2) The program forms a new array and fills it with numbers other than 0 and 1. \\

3) Using the function "setFrame()" to make the array initialized with 0s and 1s. If the frame time is set to be 4, then every 4 consecutive 1s at a position of the array means a certain station at that time will have a frame to send. \\

4) The program set a "for" loop that repeats the value of duration times. In each loop, it contains another "for" loop, which repeats the number of stations times. In each small loop, the program checks the state of one station. \\

(i) If the station has something to send and the medium is idle, then the station begins to send and the data it is sending will be received by the medium in the next larger loop. \\


(ii) If the station has something to send and the medium is busy but has no collisions, it first checks whether it sent data in the last two loops. If true, it keeps sending. If false, it waits a random number of slots based on the Binary Exponential Backoff Algorithm. The act “Waiting” is realized by postponing the value in the array by a given slots. Values, which are moved out of bound, are just discarded and the newly - produced empty slots are filled by 0s. \\


(iii) If the station has something to send and the medium is busy and has collisions, it does the same backoff strategy as in the previous part. \\

(iv) In all other states, the station does nothing. \\

(v) After each small loop, the program checks the state of the medium and report the change by changing values of several parameters. These parameters will be checked at the first of next large loop in order to simulate the one-slot delay. \\

(vi) Another array with comparatively small size will be used to record the number of successively transmitted frames of each station.

\subsection*{Results}

\subsection*{Analysis}

Although comparing to ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA, CSMA has greatly improved the efficiency of transmission. However, a user who is sending a frame needs time, which is twice of the propagation time, to capture the medium. During this small time interval, other users who happen to have packets to send may regard the medium as idle and begins to transit and thus destroys both packets. And with the increasing of propagation time caused by longer distance or lower transmission rate, this kind of fault will have larger effect and reduces the efficiency rapidly. \\

In order to minimize the influence of problem mentioned above, CSMA/CD (collision detection) is invented. It tells users whether their packets are having collisions with other packets or not. If true, both the users stop transmission to save time and wait for another chance.
