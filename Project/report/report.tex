\section*{Introduction}
What is MAC protocol?\\
In this project, we will simulate four MAC protocals including ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA, CSMA and CSMA/CD. For each protocal, the basic thoeries will be introduced first, then several assumptions that clarify ...

\section*{Pure ALOHA}
\subsection*{Theory}
ALOHA was devised by Norman Abramson in the 1970s to solve the channel allocation problem. 

\subsection*{Assumptions}

\subsection*{Simulation}

\subsection*{Results}

\subsection*{Analysis}

\section*{Slotted ALOHA}
Slotted ALOHA is an advanced version of pure ALOHA. It divides time into descrete slots that each frame can only be sent at the beginning of each time slot. Moreover, slotted ALOHA requires global time synchronization so that the same slot boundaries can be agreed by all the users.

\section*{CSMA}

\section*{CSMA/CD}
